# Grove 
![build status](https://www.bitrise.io/app/bd8ac8978e1eeb35.svg?token=ZCc9x9S22WpjqNAlc7C9Jg&branch=master)

Crowd-sourced hammock locations.

## How to build

While this app isn't really here to be contributed to (though I wouldn't mind contributions!) you can build and run it yourself if you'd like. 

All you need to do is download or clone the project, open in Xcode 7.3, and run it. Cocoapods are checked into the repo on purpose, and you shouldn't need to run `pod install` before running the app. 

## More!

The API can be found [here](https://github.com/jaredmichaelsmith/grove), and was created by my friend and incredible developer @jaredmichaelsmith.
