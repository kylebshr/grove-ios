//  DGTAuthEventDelegate is a protocol that allows app using digits sdk to listen and get notified about
//  login/signup related events. It defines a number of optional methods as the callbacks to be triggered when
//  corresponding events occur.
//
//  To use it, make a class implementing this protocol (on selected callbacks) and set the authEventDelegate property
//  on [Digits sharedInstance]
//
//  Notice that the purpose of these callbacks are for notifications, not for flow controls. So app related logging/stats would
//  be good fit for the processing in these callbacks. Executions of these callback events will be dispatched to a non ios main
//  queue/thread (created by digits sdk) to follow the best practice. As a result, these callbacks shold not do any UI related
//  operations.
//
//  This feature is in beta release which means the interface can have breaking changes
//  in the future
